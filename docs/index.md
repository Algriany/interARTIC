# Welcome to InterARTIC

InterARTIC is an interactive web application designed to simplify the use of the [ARTIC bioinformatics pipelines](https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019) for nanopore sequencing analysis on viral genomes. InterARTIC was initally designed and tested for analysis of SARS-CoV-2, but is suitable for analysis of any virus and/or amplicon scheme, including a user's own custom amplicons. InterARTIC spports both the Nanopolish and Medaka pipeline alternatives from ARTIC, with full parameter customisation enabled through a simple graphical interface.
